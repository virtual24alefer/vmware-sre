Internal Tool Coding Exercise

---> Overview
Internal Tooling Search Script: In this exercise, develop a tooling script for an on-call login abuse
incident. The script should display a count of login attempts from an IP address, where the <ip-address>
is the input variable that can be passed in to search through a ssh log file.
Candidate Instructions
Choose a computer scripting language (Python, GoLang, NodeJs, Bash, etc.) development environment
you're most comfortable with. The sample Log and IP Address are provided below. Be prepared to
discuss your submission.

Sample Log: View attach SSH Sample Logs Sample Input Values: IP addresses 112.95.230.3 ,
103.99.0.122 .

Be prepared to talk about your submission; you and one of our engineers will be walking through it.


---> Time Permitting
If you don't have the time, don't worry about it; however, please be prepared to discuss how you might:
• Create and Share Test Case Output
• Scalability and Efficiencies
• Readability


---> Final Deliverable
Please create a pull/merge request with the following:
• Title the MR the script "Work Sample Simulation"
• Scripting Solution
• A Brief How To Use - ReadMe
There is no need to email the assignment; be ready to discuss the MR during the interview.

---> Time to Complete
The recommended time to prepare you presentation is less than 1 hour. If you can't complete the
exercise in this time, please share what you have as a basis for a discussion.
